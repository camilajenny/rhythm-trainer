The pattern is more like a **sequence of durations with events happening at those timestamps**, not just 0/1 play/rest per subdivision.

The array `[1,4,2,1,2,1,0.5,0.5]` means:

* Play a hit at beat 1
* Rest until beat 4, then play
* Rest 2 beats, play
* Rest 1 beat, play
* Rest 2 beats, play
* Rest 1 beat, play
* Rest 0.5 beat, play
* Rest 0.5 beat, play

## 🎯 How to interpret and play this pattern?

Each number means:
**“Wait this many beats from the previous hit, then play the sample instantly.”**

No sustained sounds, just **short hits followed by silence of varying length**.

---

## 🧠 Implementation idea (JS)

```js
function playPatternDurations(pattern, audioSrc, bpm) {
  const beatDurationMs = 60000 / bpm;
  let currentTimeMs = 0;

  pattern.forEach((restBeats) => {
    currentTimeMs += restBeats * beatDurationMs;
    setTimeout(() => {
      const audio = new Audio(audioSrc);
      audio.play();
    }, currentTimeMs);
  });
}
```

---

## ✅ Example usage:

```js
const pattern = [1,4,2,1,2,1,0.5,0.5];
const bpm = 120;
const audioSrc = "/assets/piano1.wav";

document.querySelector('.play-sample').addEventListener('click', () => {
  playPatternDurations(pattern, audioSrc, bpm);
});
```

## 📝 Notes

* `currentTimeMs` accumulates delays between hits
* Each hit plays **instantly** (no holding)
* This handles any arbitrary rests — no need for fixed subdivisions
* If you want the **first sound instantly** at time 0, start with 0 instead of 1 in your pattern
