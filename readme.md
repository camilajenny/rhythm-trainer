## About Laravel API Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for writing RESTful API projects using Laravel. The aim of this boilerplate is to provide developers with scaffolding and common functionality which will make writing APIs exceedingly quick, efficient and convenient.

It is intended for this repository to be used when starting a new API project. Therefore, instead of cloning the laravel repository, you should clone this one.

The principles of this boilerplate are to;

 - Save developers considerable effort by using reasonable conventions
 - Allow for everything the boilerplate provides to be easily extended and entirely customised to suit developer needs, through normal PHP inheritance
   - As well as allow developers to easily use the boilerplate functionality and mix it in with their own implementation
 - Follow REST standards very closely
 - Use existing Laravel features and existing Laravel add-on packages where possible
 - Add many convenient features useful for writing APIs
 - Maintain a high level of performance

# Development

To compile SASS and move JS, webpack mix is used; it can be run using (see `package.json`):
```
npm run watch
```
